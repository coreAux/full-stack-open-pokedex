In my hypothetical scenario are working on an iOS app developed with Swift. For linting, there is a linter called SwiftLint, developed by Realm. For testing Xcode comes with a built-in testing framework called XCTest For building Xcode comes with a built in compiler that builds your code to different iOS devices.

There seems to be quite a lot of different setups to choose from, at least from a quick google search for "ci/cd swift apps". Among cloud-based services there are Bitrise, CircleCI, TeamCity, and Semaphore. Apple themselves even have a cloud-based CI/CD called Xcode Cloud that's currently in beta. For self-hosted options the only one I can really find is one by Apple called Xcode Server. In terms of self-hosted options it seems to me like the most commonly used one is Jenkins, hooking up Mac Minis as nodes and then using Fastlane for pipe lining the deployment.

Generally this seems to me a small to medium sized project seeing as we only have one team, and 6 people working on the application, although it's unclear whether it's 6 developers coding together or if a few of those 6 people have other roles than developers. This speaks for using a setup host on the cloud.

However, after having read a few articles on compromising cloud-based CI's it seems that if you're not working in a very small team or with someone who knows how to set up a secure system, a self-hosted option is the way to go. In this case, since we've stated that the team is fairly small and the application will be released soon, the cloud-based option seems to be the way forward.

I assume that changing from a cloud-based CI to a self-hosted one is not outrageously complicated and it seems that if the team grows or the application becomes very popular it may be an option to switch over to a self-hosted system.
